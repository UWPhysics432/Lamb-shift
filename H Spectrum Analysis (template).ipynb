    "\n",
    "1. Work out exercises 1, 2 and 10.  These concern the Balmer-$\\alpha$ wavelength, the term diagram of the $n=2$ to $n=3$ transitions and selection rules, and the overall layout of Doppler-free beam-crosssing method of laser spectrosopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Obtain chart-recorder scans for the two hydrogen spectrum data runs (one for \"left-to-right\" scan, i.e., decreasing wavelength, the other for \"right-to-left\", or increasing wavelength).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extract from each scan the positions in scan units (voltage or paper grid) of (1) the peaks in the Fabry-Perot (F-P) mirror output, and (2) positions of the 5 obvious peaks in the probe-beam measurement. Positions should be estimated to at least three significant figures in the measurement unit.  The F-P peak positions do not need uncertainties, but you should assign an uncertainty to the prob-beam peak positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Obtain the Fabry-Perot mirror separation measurements.  You should have 6-8 separate measurements to average.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create spreadsheets with these data to be read into the notebook for further processing.  Recommended: one .xlsx file with 5 tabs (worksheets), or 5 separate .csv files, one for the mirror measurements and one for each set of peak position measurements.  Read them in with either Pandas `read_csv()` or `read_excel()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks for this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the mirror separation measurements to meters and calculate the separation with its uncertainty (\"standard deviation of the mean\").  Then calculate the free spectral range in MHz with uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each scan:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "Plot the F-P peak index (y-axis) versus its position (x-axis).  Fit this to a 3rd-order polynomial to produce calibration coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a calibration function that takes XY recorder positions and returns position in FSR units (relative to an arbitrary origin).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the calibration function to convert probe-beam peak positions to positions in FSR units. Incorporate the uncertainty in the probe-beam peak positions to get uncertainty in FSR units.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the FSR units to frequency using the free spectral range, including uncertaities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, calculate the frequency separations requested, among them the \"Lamb shift\" which is the difference between the 2S<sub>1/2</sub>-3P<sub>3/2</sub> and 2P<sub>1/2</sub>-3D<sub>3/2</sub> transitions.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the above has been completed for both scans, combine the results to obtain the the best values for the fine-structure frequency separations, and compare the measurements to the expected values.  (these can be found in the experiment instructions.)"
